# London-Bike-predection  
project

## 1. Overview
This is a team project I did in class. This project analyzes one of the most popular data sets in Kaggle, 'London bike'. The data is a time series and we wanted to understand how much demand there is for bicycles in London, what factors contribute to it, and what the future demand might be.  

## 2. Project
- EDA
  - We used histogram and bar plot to see the respective distributions of the columns.
  - A simple heatmap shows the correlation between variables.
  - We set a baseline over time and plotted it on a graph to see how it was changing.
  - We added the holiday and weekend variables to check the graph.
  - We also saw how demand varied with temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

- Add variables to apply and compare different analysis techniques
  - Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVR, AdaBoost, Bagging Ressressor, RNN

## 3. Conclusion
We were able to create new variables using existing data and analyze them, and found that tree-based methods with ensemble techniques generally performed well in terms of accuracy. Even with a simple RNN, I was able to see how well it predicted the dataset compared to the actual predicted values.
